\# 🎵 InstruNet AI – Music Instrument Recognition System



An AI-powered web application that classifies musical instruments using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Mel Spectrogram-based audio processing.



---



\## 🚀 Project Overview



InstruNet AI is a deep learning-based system designed to:



\- 🎼 Classify musical instruments from audio files

\- 📊 Generate Mel Spectrogram visualizations

\- 🧠 Perform CNN-based feature extraction

\- 🌐 Provide an interactive web interface using Streamlit



The system converts raw audio signals into spectrogram images and feeds them into a trained CNN model for prediction.
